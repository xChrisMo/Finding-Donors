# Finding Donors 

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis to predict potential eligible donors for a charity organization using comparative supervised learning techniques. The goal is to identify individuals most likely to donate based on their demographic information.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and modeling process.
- `results.html`: HTML version of the modeling notebook, as per the project rubric.
- `census.csv`: Dataset containing demographic information for potential donors.
- `visuals.py`: Python module with functions for model evaluation and visualization.

There are two more files which describes the attributes and its values. But the main datasets files are not available because of privacy of Arvato comapny's data.

### How to Use

* Ensure all dependecies are installed
